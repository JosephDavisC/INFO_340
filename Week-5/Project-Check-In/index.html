        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>For this week's project work, we exchanged feedback on project drafts <strong>during lab</strong>. We came to lab and worked with our group to share Project Draft 1 for peer feedback.</p>
        <p>For this assignment, we submitted a copy of the written feedback we gave to another group, including which group we reviewed and the feedback itself.</p>

        <h2>First Group: AB8 (Xintong Hou, Daniel Yan)</h2>
        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Rate Our Courses - Website</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback I gave:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The website has an effective design, and the concept of rating courses instead of professors is a strong, valuable idea.</li>
            <li>The overall color palette could be more consistent across the site. The purple, while fitting the UW theme, stands out significantly and could be better integrated.</li>
            <li>The mobile version is not fully responsive on inspection. Implementing a media query is necessary to ensure the display adapts correctly to smaller screens.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Second Group: AB3 (Sharesse, Maya, An)</h2>
        <p><strong>Project:</strong> Husky Circulo - Website</p>
        <p><strong>Feedback I gave:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The website has a very clear goal and it fixes what most UW Students face when either moving out or moving in with their furniture.</li>
            <li>I like how responsive it's responsive in mobile and how much it resembles Facebook Marketplace.</li>
            <li>Maybe for the navbar, rather than making it at the top, they could make it on the side like how Facebook does it.</li>
        </ul>
