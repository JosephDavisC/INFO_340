# Planathon (Hackathon Organizer)

INFO 340 Project - Winter 2026

## Team Members

•⁠  ⁠Joseph Davis Chamdani : For this draft, I built the Tasks page with filters and task list using HTML and Bootstrap, added CSS styling for task items, created the main dashboard layout with stats cards and recent activity sections, added responsive CSS for mobile layouts, and added Dashboard navigation links across all pages.

•⁠  ⁠Kenneth Wu : For this draft, I styled the navbar with CSS, built the Features page using HTML and CSS, and created the Milestones page using HTML, Bootstrap, and added CSS to make it match the dashboard layout and style.

•⁠  ⁠Rowan Cooper : For this draft, I was in charge of creating the "how-it-works" section of the prototype. I first typed descriptions in html for creating, building, assigning, and tracking tasks as a hackathon manager. After creating semantic html for the body of the page, I updated the css file to add colors, visual formatting, and proper visual ordering. 

•⁠  ⁠Winson Teh : For this draft, I created the login and registration pages for the website. I used Bootstrap templates found online to complete these tasks. I then used Bootstrap again for the teams.html page and added placeholder images to represent team members. Lastly, I added css on all of the files.

## About

This is a web app to help hackathon organizers plan and organize their events from the beginning. Right now, organizers have to use a bunch of different tools (Google Sheets, Docs, Discord, Slack) which gets messy. Our app puts everything in one place.

## What It Does

•⁠  ⁠Event planning dashboard with milestones (registration deadlines, sponsor confirmations, schedule releases)

•⁠  ⁠Create tasks, assign them to team members, set priorities, and mark them complete

•⁠  ⁠Manage organizing teams (logistics, marketing, sponsorship, judging) and track responsibilities

•⁠  ⁠Store planning info like sponsor details, prizes, workshop schedules, and judging criteria
