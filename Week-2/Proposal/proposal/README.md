## About

This is a web app to help hackathon organizers plan and organize their events from the beginning. Right now, organizers have to use a bunch of different tools (Google Sheets, Docs, Discord, Slack) which gets messy. Our app puts everything in one place.

## What It Does

•⁠  ⁠Event planning dashboard with milestones (registration deadlines, sponsor confirmations, schedule releases)

•⁠  ⁠Create tasks, assign them to team members, set priorities, and mark them complete

•⁠  ⁠Manage organizing teams (logistics, marketing, sponsorship, judging) and track responsibilities

•⁠  ⁠Store planning info like sponsor details, prizes, workshop schedules, and judging criteria
